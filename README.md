## Rusty-Bandit  
Prototype for My Comp Explanation The goal of this prototype is to run a local version of Ruff that has been slightly manipulated within a Python program. This proves that a Rust program can be built and run within a Python program using the RustPython interpreter. Running this code as a dependency will do several forms of linting upon a file or folder within a Python program and will print the amount of time that linting takes.
## Instructions  
Step 1: Clone repo to local machine.  
Step 2: Copy path to local repo.  
Step 3: Enter root file of a Python program via terminal.  
Step 4:  Use command 'pip install (your-path-here)'   
Step 5: run 'ruff check (path to file or folder to check'.
